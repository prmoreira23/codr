# Wat App

This quiz-like game gives presents the player with very tricky javascript questions. It is javascript's nature to always give a return even it should not do so, and sometimes the results can be unpredictable. Have fun!

WAT App was developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery. It is a SPA (Single Page Application), and it turns out it is harder to create one without using a JS front-end framework or library.
